          We want you/your child to succeed! Our aim is to help alongside school
          rather than to be a substitute. Bring along any questions to us (a
          friendly face), and we will try to help. If there is nothing in
          particular your child needs help with for that week, we will have a
          backup lesson plan on a similar topic covering content to reinforce
          what your child went through in class that week and set up focus areas
          and study tips.
