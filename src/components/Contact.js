      <p>
        We want you/your child to succeed! Our aim is to help alongside school
        rather than to be a substitute. Bring along any questions to us (a
        friendly face), and we will try to help. If there is nothing in
        particular your child needs help with for that week, we will have a
        backup lesson plan on a similar topic covering content to reinforce what
        your child went through in class that week and set up focus areas and
        study tips.
