Having recently moved out of home, I‚Äôve been busy trying out different recipes whilst listening to my favourite podcasts. When I‚Äôm not cooking up my next meal, you‚Äôll most likely catch me at the gym; another favourite spot aside from the kitchen! Something I'd love to do more of is travel and explore the world outside of my hometown, New Zealand."

          The journey to success is never one-size-fits-all. This is why here at
          Trilogy Tutoring, we work to suit your own needs, whether that be help
          with schoolwork, exams or even a source of motivational support.

          Our team comes from a strong academic background, each graduating as
          Proxime Accessit/Summa Cum Laude of Rangitoto College. Over the years,
          we've collated our own set of study notes and material which has
          helped us get where we are today. This is where our personalised
          lesson plans stem from! We now study at the University of Auckland.
