          Our team comes from a strong academic background, each graduating as
          Proxime Accessit/Summa Cum Laude of Rangitoto College. Over the years,
          we've collated our own set of study notes and material which has
          helped us get where we are today. This is where our personalised
          lesson plans stem from! We now study at the University of Auckland.

                      Kia Ora! I‚Äôm Carol Huang, a 2nd year medical student at
                      the University of Auckland. I graduated as the Proxime

                      When I‚Äôm not aimlessly scrolling through TikTok, I like to
                      crochet or catch up on the latest episodes of Chicago Med
                      (Dr Rhodes ‚ô°). I‚Äôm also known for my inexplicable

                      I‚Äôve been enjoying studying medicine and learning about
                      different specialisations within the field! During my free
                      time, you can usually find me doing one of three things:
                      binge watching the latest anime, playing the piano, or
                      being carried on League of Legends.

                      I graduated from Rangitoto College in 2020 and have a
                      passion for learning which I love to share with others! My
                      appetite favours the creative side but I also enjoy the
                      satisfaction of having a challenging problem to solve.
                      Having recently moved out of home, I‚Äôve been busy trying
                      out different recipes whilst listening to my favourite
                      podcasts. When I‚Äôm not cooking up my next meal, you‚Äôll
                      most likely catch me at the gym; another favourite spot
                      aside from the kitchen! Something I'd love to do more of
                      is travel and explore the world outside of my hometown,
                      New Zealand.
